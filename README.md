# kdl_parser
Provides basic functionality of [kdl_parser_py](https://github.com/ros/kdl_parser) without ROS dependencies. Includes [urdf_parser_py](https://github.com/ros/urdf_parser_py) for that purpose.

Depends on PyKDL obviously, so please install the python bindings for Orocos KDL first. Sources and installation instructions are available [here](https://github.com/orocos/orocos_kinematics_dynamics).
